Library Seats Management System


This is just a learning project. And the background is that we want to make a full use of the library seats.
It's not good that sometimes we can see someone puts their books or papers to 'announce' 'their' chairs.
We wanna build a system to manage the resouce.

//  html+css+jquery(including some HTML5 & CSS3)
